# VaspOptimiserTests

A set of different strategies for optimising structures uning the VASP code. The routines are automated using the Atomic Simulation Enviornment (ASE).

There are tests and structures for binaries, ternaries, quaternaries and hybrid organic-inorganic materials. The results of my tests can be found in the powerpoit presentation.

To re-create these test you need:
* (VASP) [https://www.vasp.at]
* (ASE) [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/]
